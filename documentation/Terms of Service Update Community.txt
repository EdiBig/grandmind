## Final Note

**Before Launch:**
1. Have a solicitor review all legal documents (cost: Â£500-1,500)
2. Test all consent flows with real users
3. Ensure moderation systems work
4. Train your support team
5. Create internal documentation for handling reports

**After Launch:**
- Monitor reports closely in first 30 days
- Adjust Community Guidelines based on real violations
- Collect user feedback on consent flows (are they too annoying?)
- Review and update terms every 6-12 months
