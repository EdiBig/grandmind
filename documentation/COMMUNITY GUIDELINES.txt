# Kinesa Unity Community Guidelines

## Our Values
Unity is built on respect, support, and inclusivity. We're here to motivate each
other, not tear each other down.

## The Golden Rule
Treat others how you'd want to be treated. If you wouldn't say it to someone's face,
don't post it here.

## Do's

### Be Supportive
- Celebrate others' achievements
- Offer encouragement during struggles
- Share helpful tips and experiences
