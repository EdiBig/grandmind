# About Kinesa

## Our Story

Kinesa is a person-centered fitness and wellness tracking app built for real
life. We believe fitness should support you, not stress you out.

Founded in 2025 by Grandpoint Ltd, Kinesa was created out of frustration with
fitness apps that make you feel guilty for missing a day, overwhelm you with
data, or assume everyone's life looks the same.

## What Makes Us Different

### No Guilt, Just Progress

Life happens. We get it. Kinesa adapts to your energy levels, respects your
context, and celebrates progress over perfection.

### Your Health, Your Way

Choose what to track: workouts, habits, nutrition, mood, sleep, or all of it.
Only see features you care about.

### Privacy-First

Your data belongs to you. We do not sell it, we do not mine it for ads, and you
can export or delete it anytime.

## Our Mission

To make fitness tracking accessible, sustainable, and genuinely helpful for
everyone, from busy professionals to complete beginners to neurodivergent users
who have been failed by one-size-fits-all apps.
